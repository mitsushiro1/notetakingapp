## Description

I was motivated to learning the backend and how it would deploy as an app using heroku and express
I built this project as a sort of challenge for me and to see how it all interacts.
It deploys a note taking app and express helps node.js connect it to html
I learned about express js, absolutely hated it admittedly along with oop but it showed me how much more I need to learn as well.

## Installation

First clone the project, and run npm start in the terminal. you can then go to your localhost:3001 and check it out.

## Usage

Just click on get started, which will bring you to the second screen, then type in whatever you want for the notes. Click the floppy disk to save. If you want to delete some of the saved info on the left side, just click on the red garbage can and it would delete the note.
